  <h2>About the brown bear</h2>
      <p>

In the <em>heart of Alaska's wilderness</em>, a massive brown bear named Koda roamed the banks of the salmon-rich river.<br> For years, Koda protected the river and its inhabitants from harm, earning him the title of Guardian of the River.

    One summer, a severe drought hit the land, and the river's waters began to dwindle.<br> <br>The salmon struggled to survive, and the other bears grew hungry and aggressive. Koda knew he had to act.

    With his <strong>powerful sense of smell</strong>,<br>Koda sniffed out a hidden underground spring. He dug and clawed, creating a new channel to divert the spring's water into the river.<br> Slowly but surely, the river's waters began to rise, and the salmon population began to thrive once more.</p>
  
      
      <h3>Species</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>Here are the eight species of brown bears:</p>

        <li>1. _Grizzly bear_ (Ursus arctos horribilis)</li>
        <li>2. _Kodiak bear_ (Ursus arctos middendorffi)</li>
        <li>3. _European brown bear_ (Ursus arctos arctos)</li>

        <li>8. _Himalayan brown bear_ (Ursus arctos isabellinus)</li>

      </ul>
  <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>In a parched Alaskan summer, a massive brown bear named Koda discovered a hidden underground spring. With his powerful claws, he dug a new channel, diverting the water into the struggling river.

As the river's waters rose, the salmon population began to thrive. The other bears, once hungry and aggressive, now feasted on the abundant fish. Koda's selfless act earned him respect and admiration.

From that day forward, Koda watched over the river, ensuring the balance of nature remained intact. His legacy lived on, and the elder bears whispered stories of Koda's gift, which had saved their home and way of life.
